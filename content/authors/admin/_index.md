Welcome!

I am a master student in Atmospheric and Climate Science at ETH Zurich under the supervision of Dr. Edouard Davin and Prof. Sonia Seneviratne. I hold a BSc in Geographical Science from Nanjing University (2019) and will get my MSc degree in April 2021.

I work at the land climate dynamics. I am interested in how land use change affects local climate through local surface processes and larger scale atmospheric feedbacks, with a focus on forestation and deforestation. My current master thesis work is about the role of biomass heat storage in surface energy balance and how biomass heat storage influence climate through its atmospheric feedbacks.

I am seeking for possible PhD positions and available for interviews.

In my bachelor paper, I studied the near surface wind speed trend in China, with a focus on semi-arid area in Northern China. With a detailed analysis of multiple source observations and reanalysis datasets at different pressure levels, I clarify that the main possible cause for the large scale wind speed decreasing from 1982 to 2015 is not surface land use change but large-scale atmosphere circulation change under climate change and demonstrate the possible link between surface wind stilling and semi-arid region greening since 2000.
